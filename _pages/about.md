I'm a **Computational Physicist** and **Senior Research Software Engineer** with 7+ years' experience bridging numerical simulation and scalable Deep Learning. 

Currently, I'm a Senior Research Engineer at the [Institute of Computing for Climate Science (ICCS)](https://iccs.cam.ac.uk/) in Cambridge, where I work on ML-climate surrogate modelling projects. My focus is on benchmarking spin-up emulators and coupling Fortran codes with PyTorch using [FTorch](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch). 

My background spans:
- **ML/DL Engineering**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX
- **General Programming**: Python, C++, Fortran
- **Scientific Computing**: FVM/FEM solvers, CFD, numerical methods
- **HPC & Parallel Computing**: MPI, OpenMP, distributed training

Previously, I spent 6 years at the University of Cambridge, where I engineered support for large numerical software projects like FEniCSx and scaled ML training and inference on heterogeneous HPC architectures." 

I hold a **PhD in Physics (Scientific Computing) ** from the University of Cambridge in finite volume methods for continuum mechanics.
